CIS 565 Guest Lecture

Monday, September 12

**Abstract**

Sports is often considered a less exciting video game to work on but what many people don’t realize is that having a reference for the virtual world in the real world makes photorealism the name of the game. A large variety of graphics algorithms are used to achieve depth of field like broad cast cameras, crisp shadows from complex stadium lights, and down to the blades of grass on a golf course. Another thing that is vital to a game company is that everything we do is performant and that’s a large part of the decision regarding whether a feature makes it to production.

## Phenomenological Transparency

**Morgan McGuire**

CIS 565 Guest Lecture

Wednesday, November 30

### Abstract

This talk explains why transparency is one of the most significant challenges in computer rendering and presents a novel, practical solution for video games and other real-time applications. The new approach is the first to simultaneously and efficiently model all of the phenomena of transparency. These include refraction, partial coverage, colored shadows, caustics, volumetric light and shadows, and diffusion. The theme of the talk is a design methodology for real-time algorithms of driving approximations from constraints and perception instead of radiometric error.

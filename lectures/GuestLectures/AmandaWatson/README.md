## How to Get Started in Virtual Reality if You are Me

**Amanda Watson **

Guest Lecture in CIS

Monday, November 14,  6-8pm

Skirkanich Hall Berger Auditorium

### Abstract

With consumer VR still in its infancy, it remains to be seen what kinds of "experts" will emerge to define virtual reality as an industry, a platform and a medium – so why not me?  This lecture explores problems that emerge at the intersection of high-performance 3D rendering, the mobile graphics pipeline, theatricality and starting your (well, my) career after undergrad; specifically, what technical challenges convinced me as a CMU undergrad in 2015 to start my career in VR, how those challenges get tackled on modern devices, and why **you** should be excited about the challenges still to come.  From achieving presence to achieving framerate, we’ll go over the top performance gotchas that keep developers' lives interesting, and what you can be doing right now to make my problems your problems.
